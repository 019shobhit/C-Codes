// Wind chill factor is the felt air temprature or exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temprature is always lower than the air temprature, and is calculated as per the following formula:
// wcf = 35.74 +0.6215t + (0.4275t-35.75)*v(pow(0.16))
// where t is the temprature and v is the wind velocity. Write a program to recive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor (wcf).
